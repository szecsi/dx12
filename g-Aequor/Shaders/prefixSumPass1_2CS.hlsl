// Even though the shader runs per thread, threads in a thread group cooperate 
// closely in this shader. Each thread group of size THREAD_GROUP_SIZE owns 
// THREAD_GROUP_SIZE*2 *contiguous* cells, let's call them a cell group. What 
// this shader does is, per cell group, calculates two things:
// -the cell group's total sum
// -the cell group's exclusive prefix sum
//
// Used for both pass 1 (N groups) and pass 2 (M groups) of the 5-pass design,
// with different descriptor bindings each time:
//
// Pass 1:  N = numCells / ELEMENTS_PER_GROUP groups, for whom we calculate
//  u1=cellPrefixSum and u2=groupSums based on u0=cellCount.
//
// Pass 2:  M = N / ELEMENTS_PER_GROUP groups, for whom we calculate
//  u1=groupPrefixSum and u2=superGroupSums based on u0=groupSums.
//
// In other words: Pass 1 calculates the prefix sum of cell groups, and
// their group sums; Pass 2 calculates the prefix sum, and sum of the
// group sums -> super group sums.
//

// Out: cellPrefixSum, groupSums
