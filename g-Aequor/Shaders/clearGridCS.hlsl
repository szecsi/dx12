// In: cellCount
// Out: cellCount
// a note on having cellCount as an input: even though the shader only writes to it, cellCount
// has to be flushed before we zero it out, since other shaders may still be using it, due to the
// fact that it has two uses (in one pass we use it to calculate how many particles are in a cell,
// then we zero it and use it as a counter to keep track of the next free slot in the cell)
// TODO: check if we can achieve an fps improvement by separating these two uses of cellCount,
// and having a new buffer to use as a "next free cell" buffer for the sort shader
// see the related note in ComputeShader::barrier_then_dispatch
